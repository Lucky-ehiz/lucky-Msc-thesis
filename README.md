# lucky-Msc-thesis
I provided the data we used in my group for the capstone project
I got the data mainly from the National Bureau of Statistics in Nigeria, where I did my in-company training
The chapters were shared by four of us that were in the group, especially the write-up, 
The code was solely handled by Egbo Marcellininius and I using python
I did the data visualization solely with Power BI.
Then Egbo Marcerllinius, John Aluko, Lawal Abdulmumini, and I (Lucky Ehizojie) put the whole project paper into PowerPoint for presentation to the panel of judges.
